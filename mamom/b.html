            ALL MY KNOWLEDGE COMES FROM MY MODERN CYNICISM

            WHAT DON'T I LEARN SOMETHING USEFUL? ENGINEERING, TEACHING, KUNG FU...
            WHAT I LEARNED I DIDN'T NEED TO : IT WAS ALL AROUND ME ALL ALONG :
            THE ART OF LYING WITH PRECISION : JUST TO TEACH A MILLION PEOPLE :
            TO SELL THE WORLD
